                1. Introduction </br>
</br>
                    Control Shift Career is a career guidance and interview preparation service designed to empower students in their job search. We offer services such as resume writing, profile management (including LinkedIn and job search profiles), mock interviews, and assistance with common interview questions. By using our services, you acknowledge and agree that we provide guidance and support, not guaranteed job placement. </br>
</br>
                    Our referral program allows you to earn commissions by promoting our services, helping us support students financially and recover our associated costs. Additionally, you understand that Control Shift Career is not a full-time or part-time job provider with salary benefits. Any earnings through our platform are considered taxable income by law.</br>
</br>
                    By accessing and using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.</br>
</br>
                    2. Definitions</br>
</br>
                     Enrollment:  The process of purchasing a Control Shift Career guidance package.</br>
                     Referral:  The program where you earn commissions by promoting Control Shift Career services. </br>
</br>
                    3. Services</br>
</br>
                    We assist students with various aspects of their job search, including:</br>
</br>
                     - Writing effective resumes</br>
                     - Managing LinkedIn and job search profiles</br>
                     - Managing GitHub repositories (if applicable)</br>
                     - Conducting mock interviews</br>
                     - Providing scenario-based and commonly asked interview questions</br>
                     - Offering dedicated Python training during specific seasons (availability may vary)</br>
</br>
                    Additionally, we offer question banks for Prime customers and solutions to these questions at an additional cost.  </br>
</br>
                    In the future, we may expand our services to include career guidance for 12th Grade students and college admissions assistance through referrals. These additional services will also be subject to these Terms of Service.</br>
</br>
                    4. User Accounts and Registration</br>
</br>
                    The information you provide during enrollment is used to track student progress and for internal purposes such as sales and market analysis. We do not offer a traditional user account system for managing your profile.  Our primary communication channels include email, Jira, and GitHub. Users are responsible for managing their accounts for these services independently. </br>
</br>
                    This revised version clarifies your services, explains data usage, and presents information in a more professional format. </br>
</br>

</br>
                    5.2 Content Creation Requests:</br>
</br>
                    If you wish to create YouTube videos or other social media content promoting Control Shift Career, you can request permission by emailing our support team at cscstudentscare@gmail.com.  We will review your request and provide guidelines to ensure alignment with our branding and messaging.</br>
</br>
                    6. Intellectual Property Rights</br>
</br>
                    All intellectual property associated with our services, including logos, trademarks, and copyrighted materials, is our exclusive property. Users agree not to replicate or reuse these protected elements.</br>

</br>

</br>
                    7.2 Third-Party Services:</br>
</br>
                    Our services may integrate or link to third-party platforms (e.g., email, Jira, GitHub).  These platforms have their own terms and conditions, and we are not responsible for their content or practices.</br>
</br>
                    7.3 Guidance, Not Guarantee:</br>
</br>
                    Control Shift Career offers guidance and support to enhance your job search journey. We cannot guarantee job placement or specific outcomes. Your success depends on various factors, including your skills, experience, and market conditions.</br>
</br>
                    8. Limitation of Liability</br>

                    Promoting Scams: Any activity associated with fraudulent practices.</br>
</br>
                    10. Governing Law</br>

                    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India.</br>
