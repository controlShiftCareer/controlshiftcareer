        <h1>Control Shift Career FAQ</h1>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">Who should buy this package?</h3>
<p class="answer">Are you a final year student or a recent graduate with outstanding skills but struggling to land your dream job? Maybe you have some outstanding skills but haven't learned how to showcase them effectively. Our packages are designed to help students like you build confidence and crack interviews by crafting a powerful resume and developing essential interview skills.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">Why choose Control Shift Career over simply copying a sample resume?</h3>
<p class="answer">While copying a sample resume might seem like a quick fix, it has limitations. Those skills might not match your own experience, and recruiters are looking for candidates with up-to-date skills relevant to the current job market. Your resume is your first impression, and a generic copy is unlikely to stand out. We help you craft a personalised resume that highlights your unique qualifications and aligns with your desired career path. This ensures a confident start and sets you apart from the competition.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">Free AI tools vs. Control Shift Career's expert guidance:</h3>
<p class="answer">AI resume builders can be a handy starting point, but they can't guarantee a job offer.  A resume needs to stand out, and you need the skills to back it up. Our experts go beyond a basic resume. We analyse market trends, tailor your resume to showcase relevant skills, and prepare you to demonstrate your capabilities during interviews. We equip you with the knowledge and confidence to become a highly sought-after candidate.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">What does "support validity" mean?</h3>
<p class="answer">We believe in empowering students, not just handing them answers. Our packages offer varying support periods (3, 5, or 21 days) to ensure you receive personalised guidance every step of the way. You'll learn how to independently refine your profile, not just rely on one-time assistance. We provide daily programs to help you progress systematically. Our 21-day program is a comprehensive experience, simulating a real-world work environment with daily tasks and instructions. This prepares you for the demands of the job market and equips you to handle challenging interview scenarios.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">Do you provide answers to your question bank?</h3>
<p class="answer">Yes, we offer access to an answer book (additional cost) containing solutions to the most common interview questions using the STAR technique.  However, unlocking this benefit requires completing 80% of the course.  This ensures you've invested the time and effort to understand the concepts before relying solely on answers.
Trust us, by actively learning to answer the questions yourself, you'll gain the knowledge and confidence to ace any interview. Remember, our question bank covers a wide range, but it's your responsibility to apply the skills and knowledge we provide to excel.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">Do you offer dedicated coaching?</h3>
<p class="answer">Yes! We offer specialised coaching programs for high-demand fields like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and programming languages like Python and Bash Scripting. These programs are typically offered from August to April. However, we can provide Python coding training upon request. Simply contact careersupos for details on our Python course and guidance.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">Control Shift Career Refund Policy:</h3>

<p class="answer">We understand that situations can change, and you might need to adjust your plans. Here's a breakdown of our refund policy:</br>
</br>
<strong>Full Refunds:</strong></br>
</br>
<strong>Before Welcome Letter:</strong> If you need to cancel your enrollment before receiving your welcome letter (usually sent within a few hours of purchase), we offer a full refund.</br>
<strong>No Partial Refunds:</strong></br>

Currently, we don't offer partial refunds once you've received the welcome letter and started the course.</br>


<strong>Alternative Option: Referral Program</strong></br>

If you find yourself needing to pause your studies due to unforeseen circumstances, consider taking advantage of our referral program! By referring four additional students who enroll in our program, you'll recoup the full amount you invested. This is a fantastic way to support your peers while potentially recovering your investment.</br>

<strong>Important:</strong>

To request a cancellation before receiving the welcome letter, please contact us directly by phone.
Unclaimed accounts will be placed on hold after 30 days of inactivity. We can reactivate your account based on slot availability, but we recommend contacting us as soon as possible to avoid any disruption.</br>
<strong>Our Commitment:</strong>

At Control Shift Career, we're committed to your success. While we can't offer partial refunds once the course begins, we encourage you to explore the referral program as a potential solution.  We're here to support your journey and ensure you get the most out of your investment.</br></p>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3 class="question">What are the commission payout schedules?</h3>
